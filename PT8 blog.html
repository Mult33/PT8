        <p class=>At around 11:30 am, in early February of 2023, there was a performance in Del Pilar Academy’s court. To give some context, I was the Grade 8 Representative; hence, I was excused for class and was called down there for the Foundation Day dance practice. However, before this, I was watching the performance of Grade 9 students at the time, and then I saw him, a boy older than me who emerged when the curtains fell at the center of the court. This blog post is dedicated to my first and current crush, I will be sharing why I fell for him and the most memorable conversation we had.
              </p>
        <p> I compare him to a sunflower, as bright as its color and as cute as its petals. Moreover, he also reminds me of the Sun because of the burning ache I feel inside whenever I see him. I do not know why to this day, but whenever I talk to him, I am calm and collected, but the moment the conversation ends, that is when I get all flushed up. At first, I denied this feeling, but honestly, the more I gave in, the more I realized that he was a good influence. It was the 3rd academic quarter when I realized my feelings for him, at the same quarter, I had reached with highest honors. He passively influenced me because every time that I would do an activity on my computer, my wallpaper included his face.
        
        <p> One afternoon, we had a vacant class and break time; so that is 2 hours worth of free time. I decided to go to DelPA’s catwalk to walk around and breathe some fresh air, and then I saw him. he was selling graham balls with pastel marshmallows inside. There were 6 left, and I decided to just buy all of them, of course. I could tell that he was delighted by my response, and what followed was a very heartwarming conversation that I wished I could continue further. I asked about tips for dancing, and he said that I shouldn’t overthink my mistakes and that I should dance freely. Overthinking is a major problem of mine, and it’s nice that he was able to make a comment about it.
           </p> 
            
          <p>  In the end, I realized that my admiration for him wasn’t just about his looks or his charm; it was about the way he unknowingly inspired me to be better. For the first time in my life, I felt contented, he was the warmth to the cold. It has been 2 years, yet he is still the music playing over and over in my head, as cute as a sunflower, as warm as the sun, and as bright as the other stars you see in the endless abyss that’s the sky. Whether he ever knows how much he has influenced me or not, I’ll always be grateful for the way he made my world a little brighter.
